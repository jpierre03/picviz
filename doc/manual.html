<h1>Picviz: The Fine Manual</h1>
<h2>by Sebastien Tricaud (toady@gscore.org)</h2>
<i>This manual is about the right use of Picviz: its architecture, language, rendering and what you can do with it</i>
</div>
<hr/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Picviz goal is to provide a language, a library and applications to realize parallel plot coordinates graphs easily.
To help you realizing your graph, it delivers a set of types you can decide your axes to be. Everytime a value is added,
it is positioned accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Since Picviz is focused on computer security data analysis, its default types are time, ip address, string or various
kind of numbers.
</p>
<h2>The PCV language</h2>
<p>
The PCV language goal is to remain as simple as possible to map your values on your axes. It is made of at least two
sections that are <b>axes</b> definitions and their attached <b>data</b>. Two extra sections are possible: <b>header</b>
to define special properties related to your image and <b>engine</b>, to change the picviz engine behavior.
</p>
<p>
The order of each section is only important for <b>axes</b> and <b>data</b>, but a good PCV file should look like:
<pre>
header {
 ...
}
engine {
 ...
}
axes {
 ...
}
data {
 ...
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Header section</h2>
<p>
The header section can now only set the graph title. So this only way to use it is like this:
<pre>
header {
   title = "Graph title";
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Axis section</h2>
<p>
The axis section is appears like this:
<pre>
axes {
 ...
}
</pre>
Where '<i>...</i>' is your definition of axes types and properties. For example, if you want to add two axes able to receive data ranging from 0 to 65535, you should declare it as:
<pre>
axes {
        integer myaxis;
        integer thesecond;
}
</pre>
And if you want to set a label on your axis to ease its recognition, you may add the label property:
<pre>
axes {
        integer myaxis [label="My first axis"];
        integer thesecond [label="The next one"];
}
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Axis type</h3>
Every axis my be declared with a type, which can be:
<div align="center">
        <table border="1">
        <tr align="center">
        <td>Type</td><td>Range</td><td>Description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>timeline</td><td>"00:00" - "23:59"</td><td>24 hours time value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>integer</td><td>0 - 65535</td><td>Integer number</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>float</td><td>0.00 - 65534.99</td><td>Floating number</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>string</td><td>"" - "The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague."</td><td>A string value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>short</td><td>0 - 32767</td><td>Short number</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>ipv4</td><td>0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255</td><td>IPv4 address</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>gold</td><td>0 - 1433</td><td>A small value, where the gold number is the maximum</td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
        <td>char</td><td>0 - 255</td><td>A value that can be seen as a char</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
</div>
<h3>Axis properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>label</b>: sets the label to display with the graph</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data section</h2>
<p>
The data section positionates values on the axes. Its syntax is:
<pre>
   axis1="value", axis2="value, ... [prop1="val", prop2="val"];
</pre>
The value must fit the axis type. And the properties are applied on the whole line. If we deal with a string,
we map the string value with our special string: "<i>The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague.</i>". This is a special
trick to avoid your biggest string to be always on the maximum value to give you an idea when dealing with several
string axes. However, if among data a bigger string is set, it will become the biggest reference for the other strings.
</p>
<h3>Data properties</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>color</b>: sets the line color (red, blue, ...)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting dirty</h3>
<p>
Right now, you have enough to get started, so we first want to map values on three kinds of axes: time value, integer and a string.
The PCV file 'ex1.pcv' code should look like:
<pre>
header {
        title = "My first graph";
}
axes {
        timeline time [label="Time"];
        integer  nb   [label="Number"];
        string   str  [label="My string"];
}
data {
        time="0:00",nb="4242",str="This is my first string";
        time="12:00",nb="4242",str="This is my second string" [color="red"];
        time="15:00",nb="45986",str="This string is a bit bigger than the other ones" [color="blue"];
}
</pre>
Then, using the <b>pcv</b> program like this:
<pre>
$ pcv ex1.pcv &gt; ex1.svg
</pre>
And it should look like this:
<div align="center">
<img src="images/ex1.png" />
</div>
As you can see, the way strings are mapped inform you wether a string is close to an other or not. This is useful to discover a ssh scanning activity based on, say, a username change. The data here where of course choosen to be easily recognized using the color property to understand what you see.
